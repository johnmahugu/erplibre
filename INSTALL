# INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS

The simplest way to install ERP Libree is as following:

Note: You must have the Python interpreter and the wxPython library
installed on your operating system before you can run install.py
(see "Application dependencies" below).

-Unzip the erplibre.zip installer into the target folder from where
you want to run the application. You can get the installer from
http://code.google.com/p/erplibre/downloads/list

If you have ms-windows or a KDE desktop:
Double-click the file install.py in the unzipped folder

Otherwise, If your system is a GNU/Linux distribution, open a console,
and type this two commands:

cd <unzipped folder path>
./install.py

if ERP Libre is being installed in
a client machine, type this instead:
./install_client.py

# Application dependencies

You must have the following software installed in order to
install ERP Libree:

Python >= 2.5 (you can get it from http://python.org/getit/)
wxPython (wx for short) for the desktop interface - http://sourceforge.net/projects/wxpython/
web2py - http://www.web2py.com *
gui2py -http://code.google.com/p/gui2py/ *

* Both web2py and gui2py are bundled with the .zip installation and they will
automatically install unless --dep false is passed when running the install script.
If setup.py is run with the --dep false argument, the installation
script will ask for pre-installed web2py and gui2py folders
(they can be specified with --web2py_path <path> and --gui2py_path <path>.)


# Installation from the mercurial repository
(Install dependencies first. See instructions above)

-Make a clone of the project "erplibre_gui" in your system.
From a terminal run:

>hg clone https://code.google.com/p/erplibre.gui/ ./erplibre

-Inside the new created folder run:

>python setup.py --install


# Alternative no gui installation

There is an installation mode wich disables the gui interface for install ERP Libree in case you
cannot run a desktop environment. The target system still needs the before mentioned dependencies (wx, web2py and gui2py)
and the script will exit with an error code if they are not satisfied. Note that this script waits for user input during installation

from the erplibre unzipped/downloaded folder run:

>python setup.py --install --gui false
