ERPLibre is an open source software for fully featured SME management system (ERP for small and medium enterprises). The project is inspired in a set of propietary ERP tools developed with VB now developed with Python libraries.

([Ver introducción en español](http://code.google.com/p/erplibre/wiki/Inicio))

The project seeks to develop an open source / free software ERP system

It is built from a currently fully functional desktop system, which is being migrated to open source technologies, using large amount of code and methods already developed and tested. You can view the original software user's manual in the [Downloads](http://erplibre.googlecode.com/files/pyme.pdf) section.

Additionally it seeks to develop tools (code editor, designer screens, data access libraries, generating reports and lists, etc..) And that these are useful for free software in general.

The project is open to the community, colaborators and / or sponsors are welcome.

It is currently in its first release stage, and there are already user and developer resources available in this site (see the wiki for instructions). You can download the new application installer from here: http://code.google.com/p/erplibre/downloads/list
